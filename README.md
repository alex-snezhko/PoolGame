# PoolGame
An 8-ball pool simulation game created with C# and the WinForms GUI library, with a custom physics engine.

The game can be run by cloning the repo and running the project in Visual Studio (targeting .NET Framework 4.8).

To shoot the cue ball, simply click in the direction of where you want to shoot it and click. The shot's power can be adjusted with the bar on the right side of the UI.

Have fun!
